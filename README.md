This is part of a project involving financial data. The project involves specific outliers and missing values. The goal is to prepare the data for model creation.
The file examines specific financial data, where it's difficult to distinguish outliers from actual values ​​that deviate from the trend.
It's also difficult to understand how to handle missing values: remove them, replace them with zero, or replace them with central values.
